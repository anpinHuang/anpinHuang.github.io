### Ridge Regression ###

$$\hat{\beta^{ridge}} = \underset{\beta^{ridge}}{\operatorname{argmin}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y-x^T\beta^{ridge})^2 + \lambda\sum_{j=1}^{k}(\beta_j)^2$$

It can also be expressed as 
$$\hat{\beta^{ridge}} = \underset{\beta^{ridge}}{\operatorname{argmin}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y-x^T\beta^{ridge})^2 $$

subjected to $\sum_{j=1}^{k}(\beta_j)^2 \leq t$. There is one-to-one mapping between the $t$ and $\lambda$.

To ensure that variables' coefficients are penalized fairly, standardization of the variables are required before running the regression.


### Lasso Regression ###
