title: "Finite Differences for Solving PDEs"

The kind of PDEs we are interested in are the form of:


$$0 = A(t,x) + B(t,x) \frac{\partial f(t,x)}{\partial t} + C(t,x) \frac{\partial f(t,x)}{\partial x} + D(t,x) \frac{\partial^2 f(t,x)}{\partial x^2}$$

where 

$$\frac{\partial f(t,x)}{\partial t} = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{f(t+\delta ,x)-f(t,x)}{\delta}$$
