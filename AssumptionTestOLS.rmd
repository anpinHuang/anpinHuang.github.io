#### Stationary: Dickey-Fuller test
</div>
The test needs to be done for all dependent and explanatory variables individually. Regress on non-stationary time series can lead to spurious regression relationship between dependent and explanatory variables.
Test for unit root:
$$y_t = \alpha + \rho y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$
Null Hypothesis:
$$H_0: \rho = 1$$
Alternative Hypothesis:
$$H_1: \rho <1$$

The original equation can also be written as the equation below, so that by testing the significancy of $y_{t-1}$ (wheher $\theta = 0$), we can conclude that whether the time series is unit root:
$$\Delta y_t = \alpha + \theta y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$

However, when the true $\theta = 0$, the sampling distribution of $\theta$ is not normal (Central Limit Theorem no longer applies), and therefore the standard t-test on OLS regression is not valid in this case. The asymptotic distribution of the t statistic is known as Dickey-Fuller distribution. The derivation is rather mathematical intense. The Dickey-Fuller test can be done in R packages.

#### Auto-correlation: Durbin-Watson Statistics
</div>
The test needs to be done on the model residauls. The variances of the sampling distribution of $\beta$ of the OLS is not correct when there is auto-correlation in the residuals.
The simplest way to diagose auto-correlation in the error term is to plot ACF/PACF test using the R package. Durbin-Watson Statistics can also be used when there is no lag term of dependent variable in the equation.

#### Homoscedasticity
</div>
The test needs to be done on the model residauls. The variances of the sampling distribution of $\beta$ of the OLS is not correct when there is Heteroscedasticity.
