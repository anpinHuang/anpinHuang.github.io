### CECL Requirements
</div>

Under the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, publised by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the lending company is required to reserve the expected "lifetime" credit loss for the loan as early as when the loan is originated as opposed to the "incurred" loss under the old standard. The main ideas of the CECL are 

* Expected 
* Lifetime

The first point requires the forward-looking forecast for the foreseable future. A popular approach is to incorporate the economic indicators into the loss forecasting model and make the loss forecast based on the economic indicators projected by internal economists or senior management. Another approach would be to model the through the cycle loss rate and then add model overlay on top of it based on the forward economic forecast. The 2nd major difference is the requirement to reserve against the lifetime credit loss which means that the lending company not only has to have reserve to cover the loss occur in the following year, it has to have enough reserve to cover the total loss that are expected to occur in the future. For example, a loan $100K, 10 year loan, annual principal payment as 10K and has annual probability of default (PB) = 3%, the reserve under incurred loss for the following 12 months would be $100K \cdot 3\% = 3K$, whereas under CECL, the reserve would be $100K \cdot 3\%  + 90K \cdot 3\% + ...+ 10K \cdot 3\% = 16.5K$. Although it's unlikely for a loan to have uniform distribution of PD accross the life of the loan as the PD is usually quite low at the end of the loan, the example illustrates that the CECL reserve rate is significantly different from that of the incurred loss for a typical term loan.
