### Issue with Pooled OLS ###
assuming $i$ is the index for different city and $t$ is the index for time. We are trying to see the relationship between house price $HP$ and crime rate.
$$HP_{i,t} = \beta_0+\beta_1 Crime_{i,t} + V_t + \alpha_i + u_{i,t}$$
where $V_t$ is time dependent variable which represent the time trend across all cities, and $\alpha_i$ is the city specific variable that is fixed across time (e.g. geographic, demographic, race, education).
if $\alpha_i$ is not in the OLS, then it would end up in the error term, and $cov(Crime_{i,t}, \alpha) \neq0$ (a city's crime rate can be related to its city specific variables). In this case the $\beta$ is biased and inconsistent.


### First Difference Approach ###
$$
\begin{aligned} 
\Delta HP_{i,t} &= \beta_0-\beta_0 + \beta_1 \Delta Crime_{i,t} + V_{t} - V_{t-1} + \alpha_i-\alpha_i + u_{i,t}^{'}\\
&= \beta_1 \Delta Crime_{i,t}  + V_{t} - V_{t-1} + u_{i,t}^{'}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now the city's specific effect has been removed, and $\beta_1$ is consistent estimated this way.


### Fixed Effect Approach ###
$$HP_{i,t} = \beta_0+\beta_1 Crime_{i,t} + \beta_2 Unemployment_{i,t} + \alpha_i + u_{i,t}$$
$$\bar{HP_i} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T}HP_{i,t}$$
$$\bar{\alpha_{i}} = \frac{1}{T}T\alpha_{i} = \alpha_i$$

Thus, 

$$\bar{HP_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \bar{Crime_i}+\beta_2 \bar{Unemployment_i}+\alpha_i+\bar{u_i}$$

Then

$$HP_{i,t}-\bar{HP_i} = \beta_1 (Crime_{i,t}-\bar{Crime_i}) + \beta_2 (Unemployment_{i,t}-\bar{Unemployment_i}) + (u_{i,t}-\bar{u_i})$$

### Dummy Variables Estimator ###

$$HP_{i,t} = \beta_0+\beta_1 Crime_{i,t} + \beta_2 Unemployment_{i,t} + \alpha_i + u_{i,t}$$

$$HP_{i,t} = \beta_0+\beta_1 Crime_{i,t} + \beta_2 Unemployment_{i,t} + \mu_1d_2 + \mu_2d_3 + u_{i,t}$$
where $d_2 = 1, when i=2, =0, otherwise$.
This way, we can actually estimate $\alpha_i$, however, if we have larger number of different cities, then this approach becomes unrealistic.

### Estimating Unobserved Heterogeneity ###
$$HP_{i,t} = \beta_0+\beta_1 Crime_{i,t} + \beta_2 Unemployment_{i,t} + \alpha_i + u_{i,t}$$
Now we want to foucs on estimating $\alpha_i$, the heterogeneity

### $R squared in Fixed Effect/LSDV ###

$$\tilde{HP_{i,t}} = \beta_1\tilde{Crime_{i,t}}+\beta_2\tilde{Unemployment_{i,t}}+\tilde{u_{i,t}}$$

$R^2$ here means the variation of $HP_{i,t}$ explained by the model relative to $HP_i$
