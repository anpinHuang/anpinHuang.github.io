### Issue with Pooled OLS ###
assuming $i$ is the index for different city and $t$ is the index for time. We are trying to see the relationship between house price $HP$ and crime rate.
$$HP_{i,t} = \beta_0+\beta_1 Crime_{i,t} + V_t + \alpha_i + u_{i,t}$$
where $V_t$ is time dependent variable which represent the time trend across all cities, and $\alpha_i$ is the city specific variable that is fixed across time (e.g. geographic, demographic, race, education).
if $\alpha_i$ is not in the OLS, then it would end up in the error term, and $cov(Crime_{i,t}, \alpha) \neq0$ (a city's crime rate can be related to its city specific variables). In this case the $\beta$ is biased and inconsistent.


### First Difference Approach ###
$$
\begin{aligned} 
\Delta HP_{i,t} &= \beta_0-\beta_0 + \beta_1 \Delta Crime_{i,t} + V_{t} - V_{t-1} + \alpha_i-\alpha_i + \Delta u_{i,t}\\
&= \beta_1 \Delta Crime_{i,t}  + V_{t} - V_{t-1} + \Delta u_{i,t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now the city's specific effect has been removed, and $\beta_1$ is consistent estimated this way.


### Fixed Effect Approach ###
$$HP_{i,t} = \beta_0+\beta_1 Crime_{i,t} + \beta_2 Unemployment_{i,t} + \alpha_i + u_{i,t}$$
$$\bar{HP_i} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T}HP_{i,t}$$
$$\bar{\alpha_{i}} = \frac{1}{T}T\alpha_{i} = \alpha_i$$

Thus, 

$$\bar{HP_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \bar{Crime_i}+\beta_2 \bar{Unemployment_i}+\alpha_i+\bar{u_i}$$

Then

$$HP_{i,t}-\bar{HP_i} = \beta_1 (Crime_{i,t}-\bar{Crime_i}) + \beta_2 (Unemployment_{i,t}-\bar{Unemployment_i}) + (u_{i,t}-\bar{u_i})$$

### Dummy Variables Estimator ###

$$HP_{i,t} = \beta_0+\beta_1 Crime_{i,t} + \beta_2 Unemployment_{i,t} + \alpha_i + u_{i,t}$$

$$HP_{i,t} = \beta_0+\beta_1 Crime_{i,t} + \beta_2 Unemployment_{i,t} + \mu_1d_2 + \mu_2d_3 + u_{i,t}$$
where $d_2 = 1, when i=2, =0, otherwise$.
This way, we can actually estimate $\alpha_i$, however, if we have larger number of different cities, then this approach becomes unrealistic.

### Estimating Unobserved Heterogeneity ###
$$HP_{i,t} = \beta_0+\beta_1 Crime_{i,t} + \beta_2 Unemployment_{i,t} + \alpha_i + u_{i,t}$$
Now we want to foucs on estimating $\alpha_i$, the heterogeneity

### R Squared in Fixed Effect/LSDV ###

$$\tilde{HP_{i,t}} = \beta_1\tilde{Crime_{i,t}}+\beta_2\tilde{Unemployment_{i,t}}+\tilde{u_{i,t}}$$

$R^2$ here for fixed effect model means the variation of $HP_{i,t}$ explained by the model relative to $HP_i$.

For LSDV, the high $R^2$ is not surprised and not very indicative. Even without the crime and unemployment rate, we still have dummy variables (city specific) and year in the model.

### First Difference v.s. Fixed Effect\LSDV ###

$$T=2: FD = FE$$

$$T \geq3 : FD \neq FE$$

Both $\hat\beta_{FD}$ and $\hat\beta_{FE}$ are unbiased, so we compare the efficiency.

$$HP_{i,t} = \beta_0+\beta_1 Crime_{i,t} + \beta_2 Unemployment_{i,t} + \alpha_i + u_{i,t}$$

$cov(u_{i,t}, u_{i,t-1} = 0$ then 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
Cov(\Delta u_{i,t}, \Delta u_{i,t-1}) &= Cov(u_{i,t}-u_{i,t-1},u_{i,t-1}-u_{i,t-2}) \\
&= Cov(u_{i,t-1},u_{i,t-1}) \\
&= -Var(u_{i,t-1})
\end{aligned} 
$$ 
Therefore, if we have serial uncorrelated idiosyncratic errors $u_{i,t}$ then $\Delta u_{i,t}$ is serially correlated, and therefore fixed effect is preferred. However, if we have serial correlated $u_{i,t}$, then it depends on the $\rho$ of $u_{i,t} = \rho u_{i,t-1} + \epsilon_{i,t}$.

However, in both method, we don't actually estimate the $u_{i,t}$, so we don't know if they are serially correlated. We can do use the estimation from first difference:


if $Cov(\Delta \hat u_{i,t}$ is significant negative, then FE is favorable
if $Cov(\Delta \hat u_{i,t} = 0$ then FD is favorable.

In the end, it is better to do both, and examine the difference of these two estimators.

If $T>N$,where $N$ is small, then FE is quite sensitive. If $X_{i,t}$ is unit root, then FE is subject to spurious regression. 

If $T$ is very large, then FE is less sensitive than FD with respect to violation of strict exogeneity ($Cov(u_{i,t}, X_{i,s})$)
