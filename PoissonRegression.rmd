#### Model the count

The dependent variable $Y$ is the count, or it can be $Y/t$ referring to the frequency where $t$ is the time interval. The response $Y$ follows poisson distrubition and $E[Y] = \mu$

If we use OLS model:

$$ \mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1$$

The model can have forecast value $\hat{\mu} < 0$. To solve this issue, we model the log count.

$$log(\mu) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1$$


#### Model the rate

$$
\begin{aligned}
log(\frac{\mu}{t}) &=  \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1\\
log(\mu) - log(t) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1\\
log(\mu) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + log(t) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

$log(t)$ is referred to as an **offset**
