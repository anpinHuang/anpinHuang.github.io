Recall that Binomial Distribution:

$$P(X=x) = C_x^n P^x (1-p)^{n-x}$$

Assumptions:
* The probability of 2 or more events occur in a sufficiently short interval is 0
* Probability of event occur is independent between non-overlapping intervals
* The probability of exactly 1 event occurs in a sufficiently short interval $h$ is $\lambda h$


Given the above assumptions, the probability of an event occur in any one subinterval $\frac{1}{n}$ is $\lambda(\frac{1}{n}) = \frac{\lambda}{n}$

Derive poisson distribution by taking $n\to\infty$ of the binomial distribution:
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(X=x) &= \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} \cdot (\frac{\lambda}{n})^x \cdot (1-\frac{\lambda}{n})^{n-x}\\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n(n-1) ...(n-x+1)}{n^x} \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}(1-\frac{\lambda}{n})^n(1-\frac{\lambda}{n})^{-x} \\
&= 1 \cdot \frac{\lambda^x}{x!} \cdot e^{-\lambda} \cdot 1 \\
& = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}
\end{aligned} 
$$
