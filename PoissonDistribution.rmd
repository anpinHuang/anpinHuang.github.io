title: "Poisson Distribution"

Poisson distribution describe the probability of $x$ times of arrivals in a given time interval, denoted as $P(X=x)$. Poisson distribution has a parameter $\lambda$, called the **arrival rate** or **intensity**.

Assumptions:

* **Time-homogeneity**: The probability of k arrivals is the same for all intervals of the same length $\tau$.
* **Independence**: The number of arrivals duraing a particular time interval is independent of the history outside of this interval.
* **Small Interval Probabilities**: For a small interval $\tau$ where $\tau \to 0$, the probability of 1 arrival $P(X=1) = \lambda \tau$


Given the above assumptions, the probability of 1 event occurs in any one small interval $\frac{1}{n}$ is $\lambda(\frac{1}{n}) = \frac{\lambda}{n}$


Recall that Binomial Distribution:

$$P(X=x) = C_x^n \ \ p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$$

Derive poisson distribution for a time interval of 1 unit by taking $n\to\infty$ of the binomial distribution. Each trial is a Bernoulli process - whether there is 1 event occurs in a small inverval of time $\frac{1}{n}$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(X=x) &= \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} \cdot (\frac{\lambda}{n})^x \cdot (1-\frac{\lambda}{n})^{n-x}\\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n(n-1) ...(n-x+1)}{n^x} \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}(1-\frac{\lambda}{n})^n(1-\frac{\lambda}{n})^{-x} \\
&= 1 \cdot \frac{\lambda^x}{x!} \cdot e^{-\lambda} \cdot 1 \\
& = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}
\end{aligned} 
$$


#### Probability for the time T of the first arrival
The probability for the time T of the first arrival follows **Exponential distribution**. The first arrival time between $0$ and $t$ is given by the cumulative distribution $F_T(t)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_T(t) &= P(T \leq t) \\
 &= 1-P(T>t)\\
 &= 1-Poisson(0,t)\\
 &= 1- e^{-\lambda t}\\
\end{aligned} 
$$

The p.d.f. can then be derived by taking the derivative:

$$f_T(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}$$
